Why
-

To provide a basic set of unit tests to help people learning Haskell (including myself) go through the [99 Haskell Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions).

Suggestions are highly appreciated, feel free to add them to the [wiki](99_haskell_problems/wiki) or drop me an e-mail.

Getting Started
-
Assuming you have [haskell](http://haskell.org)* and [git](http://git-scm.com) installed:

    git clone git://github.com/boccato/99_haskell_problems.git
    cd 99_haskell_problems
    runhaskell 1to10.hs

*I am using [The Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), version 2012.2.0.0.
