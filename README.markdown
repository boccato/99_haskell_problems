99 Haskell Problems
=

This project provides a basic set of unit tests to help people learning Haskell (including myself) go through the [99 Haskell Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions).

Suggestions are highly appreciated, feel free to add them to the [wiki](https://github.com/boccato/99_haskell_problems/wiki) or drop me an e-mail.
